# SunnyTexter
SunnyTexter is a Python script that will send a text/email when it is sunny! Covers any location that Google will pull from Weather.com.

# Goal 
To help people remember to take a break and get outside when there's sunshine.

# Repository Organization
The code_and_code_accessories folder contains the sunnytexter.py code, with an example of a .json file showing the structure used for both user data and the username/password of the email account that sends the final message. A test file is also present. The docs folder contains project planning used for class. The .gitignore ignores .json files in order to not publish any personal information.

# Future Ideas
Currently this just runs manually, but in the future it could be automated
